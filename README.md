We decided to work on the third option that required creating a gamme that sensitizes about the symptoms and prevention tips related to the thrombosis.

As developers, we were inspired to create this project after learning about the importance of thrombosis prevention and the lack of widespread awareness about the condition. We wanted to create a resource that would be both educational and engaging, in order to effectively raise awareness about thrombosis and its symptoms among the general population.

To build the project, We first conducted research on the physiology of thrombosis and identified key symptoms and preventative measures that we wanted to include in the game. We then worked together as a team to create a fun and interactive game that would teach players about thrombosis through gameplay.

One of the biggest challenges we faced was finding a way to effectively convey complex medical information in a way that was both accurate and easily understandable to players.

Overall, creating this project was a rewarding and educational experience. We hope that by bringing attention to the importance of thrombosis prevention, we can help reduce the incidence of thrombotic events and improve the health and well-being of individuals worldwide.
